A bar chart or histogram visually represents the distribution of data. For categorical variables, such as gender, a bar chart shows the frequency of each category. For continuous variables, like age, a histogram groups data into bins, highlighting patterns, trends, or skewness, making it easier to compare and analyze population characteristics.
